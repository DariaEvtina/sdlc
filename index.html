  <h2>Accordion</h2>

  <button class="accordion">Requirement analysis and Planning</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Requirements analysis and planning are the keys to the success of an implementation.<br> <br>The difficulty is not particularly in installing the software nor in configuring it, but rather more about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>knowing what to configure,</li>
      <li>deciding if you should adapt the software, or perhaps change your method of working, for some of your specialized processes,</li>
      <li>forming teams that can specify and work on some of the changes,</li>
      <li>ensuring that your users are committed to the change.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Defining requirements</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Defining requirements creates the foundation of a successful business intelligence (BI) solution by documenting what will be built. The categories of requirements are: business, data and data quality, functional, regulatory and compliance, and technical.<br> <br>Per BABOK guide, official definition of requirement is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>“A condition or capability needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.”</b> In simpler words, a decision-making process to derive requirements from needs.</li>
      <li><b>“A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a solution or solution component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed documents.”</b>It is a step where business requirements are drafted as solutions requirements to get started with developing the solution.</li>
      <li><b>“A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2.”</b> The documentation is itself a requirement as it helps all the stakeholders and consumers in understanding the requirements for the solution.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Defining the Product Architecture</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Product architecture is the organization (or chunking) of a product's functional elements. It's the ways these elements, or chunks, interact.<br> <br><b>Basic steps:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a schematic of the product</li>
      <li>Cluster the elements of the schematic</li>
      <li>Draft a geometric layout</li>
      <li>Identify fundamental and incidental interactions</li>
    </ol>

  <button class="accordion">Testing the Product</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The testing phase of product development ensures that the product operates as expected. This phase begins after the implementation of the product requirements.<br> <br><h3>Purposes</h3>Product testing might have a variety of purposes, such as: <br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine if, or verify that, the requirements of a specification, regulation, or contract are me</li>
      <li>Decide if a new product development program is on track: Demonstrate</li>
      <li>Provide standard data for other scientific, engineering, and quality assurance functions</li>
      <li>Validate suitability for end-use</li>
      <li>Provide a basis for technical communication</li>
      <li>Provide a technical means of comparison of several options</li>
      <li>Provide evidence in legal proceedings: product liability, patents, product claims, etc.</li>
      <li>Help solve problems with current product</li>
      <li>Help identify potential cost savings in products</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Deployment in the Market and Maintenance</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The deployment phase is the final phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and puts the product into production.brˇ<br><h3>Deployment</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the system meets your approval and is ready to “go live”, we deploy it to your production environment and assist with your organization’s transition to the new system.</li>
      <li>The development platforms we use support  a broad range of deployment options.</li>
      <li>There is no need to install any software on end-users machines – all software is installed on the server.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Systems evolve after deployment. We will continue to make improvements and changes to your systems as needed.</li>
      <li>With Servoy, delivering the latest revisions to your users is a snap, and is completely transparent to your users</li>
      <li>We can also  train your development teams in how to maintain the system.</li>

    <h3>What is a Gantt Chart?</h3>
    <p>A Gantt chart, commonly used in project management, is one of the most popular and useful ways of showing activities (tasks or events) displayed against time. On the left of the chart is a list of the activities and along the top is a suitable time scale. Each activity is represented by a bar; the position and length of the bar reflects the start date, duration and end date of the activity. This allows you to see at a glance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What the various activities are</li>
      <li>When each activity begins and ends</li>
      <li>How long each activity is scheduled to last</li>
      <li>Where activities overlap with other activities, and by how much</li>
      <li>The start and end date of the whole project</li>
